🗣️ Core Meeting Clarity Agent: Multimodal Communication Analyzer

Timeline: 5-Day Placement Project | Focus: LLM Structured Output & Agentic Workflow | Status: Complete (MVP)

This project delivers a specialized AI agent designed to objectively measure and improve communication clarity in professional video meetings. By integrating high-fidelity ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) with Large Language Model (LLM) semantic analysis, the agent provides a quantifiable metric—the Meeting Clarity Index—to flag ambiguous language and excessive jargon.

✨ Key Features & Unique Contributions

This project moved beyond a standard tutorial by implementing advanced, real-world features:

Weighted Clarity Index (Scoring Logic): Calculates a nuanced score (0-100). The LLM assigns a penalty weight ($0.0 - 1.0$) to each jargon term based on its ambiguity, ensuring highly abstract buzzwords (synergy) are penalized more than common technical terms (Q4 goals).

Per-Speaker Contribution Analysis: Uses ASR Speaker Diarization data to track which individual speaker contributed the most jargon, enabling targeted communication coaching.

Structured Output & Auditing: The Gemini API is forced via a Pydantic schema to return a clean, machine-readable JSON report of jargon, weights, and critiques.

Highlighting & Review: Visually pinpoints every identified jargon term in the full transcript on the Streamlit dashboard.

⚙️ Project Architecture and Technical Flow

The application executes a robust, three-stage pipeline  triggered by a video file upload:

Ingestion & Pre-processing (Python/MoviePy): Handles video extraction, duration validation, and ensures FFmpeg access via absolute path configuration.

ASR Layer (AssemblyAI): Transcribes audio and provides Speaker Diarization (identifying Speaker A, B, etc.).

LLM Semantic Analysis (Gemini/Mistral): Executes the core reasoning task. This layer supports switching between the high-reliability Cloud (Gemini) API and the low-cost Local (Ollama RAG) implementation, which grounds its analysis in the custom jargon_master_list.csv dataset.

Presentation (Streamlit): Synthesizes the results into a user-friendly dashboard with charts and color-coded metrics.

🚀 Setup and Installation

Prerequisites

Python 3.9+ (with venv activated)

FFmpeg: The executable must be installed and accessible via the path configured in src/utils.py.

API Keys: Keys for AssemblyAI and Gemini set in the .env file. (Ollama requires the local server to be running instead of the Gemini Key.)

Steps

Clone the Repository (or ensure files are up-to-date).

Install Dependencies: (Ensure your venv is active)

pip install streamlit moviepy assemblyai google-genai pandas python-dotenv pydantic tabulate ollama


Run the Application:

streamlit run app.py


🎤 Presentation Talking Points

The presentation should be focused, professional, and emphasize your unique contributions:

Topic

Key Talking Points (Focus on Action)

The Problem

Ambiguous language (jargon) is a costly enterprise problem, not just a nuisance. It kills efficiency and causes project misinterpretation.

The Solution

The Agent provides an objective, quantifiable metric (the Clarity Index) to measure communication quality.

Technical Depth (The Core)

I built a multimodal pipeline (ASR + LLM) that bypasses traditional NLP by using LLM's zero-shot reasoning for semantic analysis.

Unique Feature: Scoring

We use a Weighted Penalty System (0.0 to 1.0) assigned by the LLM to penalize severity, not just count, jargon words.

Unique Feature: Coaching

The Per-Speaker Contribution Chart transforms data into actionable HR/coaching feedback, identifying who needs the most clarity training.

Scalability

The app supports switching to a low-cost, internal Ollama (local RAG) engine, proving the architecture is ready for enterprise deployment and cost-optimization.
